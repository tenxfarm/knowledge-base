# Aquaponics

Aquaponics is a system that combines the growing of fish and plants. It is the integration of Aquaculture and Hydroponics, combined into a new discipline. It has its own rules and method of operation.

**It eliminates difficulties both these disciplines have:**
Water in both systems becomes overloaded with nutrients and has to periodically be run to waste. Aquaponics only loses water through natural evaporation and transpiration by the plants.

Synthetic chemicals and pesticides are used in various forms in Aquaculture and Hydroponics. In Aquaponics it is guaranteed they arenâ€™t used, as their application destroys the natural balance of an Aquaponic system and can result in fish deaths.
